Ever since July of this year, I have battling a relentless bot that attacked my php files for this blog and all my other sites on the same server. After months of narrowing down the problems and fixing the vulnerabilities, I am now confident to continue contributing to this blog. Apologies if I kept you up late at night hitting refresh until I posted something new. I know this is Oscar winning content, but my much more exciting day job has been getting most of my attention.
