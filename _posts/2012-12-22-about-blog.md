With all these great Building Information Models that Architects and Contractors are creating, how else can we use them to beneficially impact our industry?

&nbsp;

With thousands of awesome BIM related blogs on the internet these days providing great tips and topics regarding content creation, I have found that few really shed light on working within BIM environments in the latter stages of building design and construction.  These latter stages often require the ability to collaborate with and coordinate between multiple designers and contractors who are using various modeling platforms.  Additionally, both designers and contractors desire vastly different performance requirements from the models they receive and create.

&nbsp;

This blog will be a resource on technologies, tips &amp; tricks, and topics around virtual design and construction that demonstrates how to take advantage of the information within BIMs.
